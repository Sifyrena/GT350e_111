## What's new in v1.1.1?
- Reworked body topology and smoother reflections.
- Blinkers turn on when on Turbo...
- Detailed brake light design and new spoilers.
- Windshield wipers if anybody asked for them. I made them using Blender's default cube.
- UV Reprojected to separate different panels.

Feel free to use the template to create more advanced racing graphics.
